Final (mini) Project

Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning. Follow these steps to build a web scraping project from scratch using Python and its ecosystem of libraries:

 

Scope your target website and describe your objective

Browse through https://www.consumeraffairs.com/
Consumer affairs contains reviews about thousands of brands. Can you scrape any category from the site to create a dataset of Reviews containing information like Title, Rating, Reviews and toll-free number etc.?
Identify the information you'd like to scrape from the site. Decide the format of the output CSV file.
Summarize your project idea and outline your strategy in a ReadMe file.

Use the requests library to download web pages

Inspect the website's HTML source and identify the right URLs to download.
Download and save web pages locally using the requests library.
Create a function to automate downloading for different topics/search queries.

Use Beautiful Soup to parse and extract information

Parse and explore the structure of downloaded web pages using Beautiful soup.
Between your group members, split the website into sections and scrape different data
Use the right properties and methods to extract the required information.
Create functions to extract from the page into lists and dictionaries.
(Optional) Use a REST API to acquire additional information if required.

Create CSV file(s) with the extracted information

Create functions for the end-to-end process of downloading, parsing, and saving CSVs.
Execute the function with different inputs to create a dataset of CSV files.
(Optional) Verify the information in the CSV files by reading them back using Pandas.

Document and share your work

Add proper comments and documentation in your repository.
(Optional) Write a blog post about your project and share it online.
